## Installing
You can simply run the EXE file you can find in the [releases](https://github.com/NM-Games/ColSel/releases):
- by clicking it in File Explorer;
- by launching it from the terminal. You can add `/t` as argument to display the window always on top right after starting.

## Selecting colors
Selecting a color can be done in many ways:
- Use the [Select a color...] button;
- Change the value of the RGB, CMY, Hex, OLE or ARGB input box.
  - Note that the HSL and Hash code input boxes are read-only!  
  
The chosen color is displayed in the top of the window. All input boxes will be updated if the color changes, regardless of how it is done.

# Have fun using ColSel!
